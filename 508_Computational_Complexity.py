# Computational Complexity = 10000, O(n) / O(1) / O(n^2) / O(log(n))
#   O(n log n) / O(2^n)

# PROBLEM

# Rank the following terms by order of growth, from smallest to largest. Drag each term to its proper place on the diagram; be sure to use each term exactly once.

# Rank 1: 500000 
# Rank 2: log log n 
# Rank 3: log n 
# Rank 4: n 
# Rank 5: n*log n 
# Rank 6: n**2 
# Rank 7: n**3 
# Rank 8: 3**n 
# Rank 9: n**n 
# Rank 10: 2**(n**2)
