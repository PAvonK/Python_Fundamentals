#What method is called when an object is created?  = __init__

# If you have an object instance, obj, and you want to call its doSomething() 
#    method (assuming it has one), how would you do this? (write the line of 
#    code you would use)?  = obj.doSomething()
    
# True or False? An object's attributes must be defined in the 
#    object's __init__ method.  = False
    
# The following code starts the definition of a class called Address. The 
#    class needs to have two attributes: number and streetName. Please add in 
#    the two lines of code that will create these attributes from the 
#    appropriate passed in parameters.
    
# class Address(object):
#    def __init__(self, number, streetName):
#        # Line 1: Creating a number attribute
#        # Line 2: Creating a streetName attribute
        
# What is the correct expression for # Line 1? = self.number = number

# What is the correct expression for # Line 2? = self.streetName = streetName
